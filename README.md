This temperature sensor utilises a DHT11 grove temperature sensor connected to a raspberry pi to monitor temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment. It as an LCD screen that displays this data, and this data is also uploaded to a Thingspeak channel to allow
for data visualisation. This project also uses an Arduino with a RGB LED that is used to visually show the temperature with corresponding colours. red = hot, blue = cold , green = within the set parameters. the raspberry pi communicates with the Arduino via Wi-Fi.
